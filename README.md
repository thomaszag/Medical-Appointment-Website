Brief Description - The Medical Appointment Website was designed to allow patients to schedule appointments so that office resources could be freed. In order for patients to schedule for appointments, they must first create an account using standard information such as name, email, phone number, insurnace providers, etc. A unique username and password is needed to create an account. Once the account is created patients can access appointment times and schedule for appointments.
